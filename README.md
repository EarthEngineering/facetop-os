## Installation

Installation should be fairly straight forward, you will need a computer for this step.
(everything after this can be set up on a mobile device.)

### Linux/OSX

 1. download the latest release file.
 2. ```dd if=</path/to/file> of=/dev/<sddevice> bs=4``` or use [Etcher](https://etcher.io/).
